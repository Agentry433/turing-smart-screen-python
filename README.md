# turing-smart-screen-python-HIDdev

`turing-smart-screen-python-HIDdev` is a modified fork of `turing-smart-screen-python` with added support for 3.5" SmartMonitor devices that appear on Linux as USB HID (`0483:0065`) instead of serial/TTY displays.

Based on the original project:

- https://github.com/mathoudebine/turing-smart-screen-python

## Features

- Linux `hidraw` backend for SmartMonitor
- Theme upload over HID/YMODEM
- Live runtime metrics for CPU, GPU, RAM, disk and network
- Vendor theme support (`.dat`)
- Vendor UI conversion (`.ui -> .dat`)
- SmartMonitor GUI integration in `configure.py`
- Dedicated SmartMonitor theme editor with 480x320 canvas preview

## Main Files

- `main.py` — start the monitor runtime
- `configure.py` — GUI configuration, theme selection, import and conversion
- `smartmonitor-theme-editor.py` — SmartMonitor UI editor
- `tools/smartmonitor-theme-manager.py` — CLI theme manager
